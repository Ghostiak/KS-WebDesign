Trail

Crack, crack, sticks beneath my feet.
I will pick up one to keep.
Hold it always by my side,
Take it along for the ride.

Shush, shush, a wind on the lake.
Here there is nothing to take.
Watch the fish swim unaware.
Be still so they do not scare.

Pip, pip, a light rain on the grass.
Pick some flowers as I pass.
Weave them into my hair,
A frail wilting crown to wear. 

Tonk, Tonk, steps on the railroad. 
Tell me, where did the trail go?
